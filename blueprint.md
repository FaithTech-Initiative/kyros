# Kyros Note-Taking App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture, features, and development plan for the Kyros note-taking application. The goal is to create a feature-rich, intuitive, and visually appealing note-taking experience for users.

## Implemented Features (as of now)

*   **Firebase Authentication:** Users can sign in using email/password and Google Sign-In.
*   **Basic App Structure:** A home screen, authentication screen, and basic navigation are in place.
*   **Themeing:** The app uses a theme provider to manage light and dark themes, with support for dynamic colors on Android.
*   **Initial Scaffolding:** The project is set up with necessary dependencies and a basic file structure.

## Plan for a Robust Note-Taking Feature

Here is the step-by-step plan to implement a comprehensive note-taking feature:

1.  **Local Database Setup:**
    *   Create a `Note` model to define the structure of a note (id, title, content, timestamp, etc.).
    *   Implement a `DatabaseHelper` class to manage a local SQLite database for storing notes. This will allow for offline access and faster performance.

2.  **Note Creation and Editing:**
    *   Develop a `NoteScreen` that allows users to create new notes and edit existing ones.
    *   This screen will feature a rich text editor for a great writing experience.
    *   Integrate the `NoteScreen` with the `DatabaseHelper` to save and update notes.

3.  **Displaying Notes:**
    *   Modify the `HomeScreen` to display a list of all notes from the local database.
    *   Implement a visually appealing layout for the note list, showing a preview of each note's content.

4.  **Firestore Synchronization:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to sync the local notes with a user-specific collection in Firestore.
    *   This will ensure that a user's notes are backed up and accessible across multiple devices.

5.  **Enhanced Note-Taking Features:**
    *   Add the ability to archive and delete notes.
    *   Implement a search functionality to easily find notes.
    *   Allow users to attach images and audio recordings to their notes.

I will now start by creating the `Note` model and the `DatabaseHelper` class.
